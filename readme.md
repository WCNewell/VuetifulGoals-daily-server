## My first "full-stack" application!

The front-end aka client side of this application was built using Vue.js abd the Vuetify CSS and Ez-fetch libraries, then deployed to Firebase.

*Vuetify provides the developer with a library of css elements built in the style of Material Design by Google

*Ez-fetch is a library that provides the developer with easy connectivity to an API designed by renowed CJ Reynolds, a former instructor of mine at Galvanize. Watch Coding Garden by CJ on YouTube:

*The goal entry form has entry requirements with warnings to the user, and insufficient submission is disallowed.

*Two Cypress tests are included

This application was designed to demonstrate Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) connectivity to an API / back-end database, which I designed using Express, Knex and PostgreSQL, then deployed to Heroku.
