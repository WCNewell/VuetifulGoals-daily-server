## My first "full-stack" application!

The front-end aka client side of this application was built using Vue.js the Vuetify CSS and Ez-fetch libraries then deployed to Firebase.

*Vuetify provides the developer with a library of css elements built in the style of Material Design by Google

*Ez-fetch is a library that provides the developer with easy connectivity to an API designed by renowed CJ Reynolds. Search for Coding Garden by CJ on YouTube.

*The goal entry form has entry requirements with warnings to the user, and insufficient submission is disallowed.

*Two minimal Cypress tests are included

This application was designed to demonstrate Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) connectivity to an API which I designed using Express, Knex and PostgreSQL, then deployed to Heroku.
